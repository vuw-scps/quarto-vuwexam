## FIRST SECTION 

1. Multiple choice questions. Briefly justify your answer if unsure. 
   #. The reflectance of a planar multilayer structure increases with the addition of a metal layer:
      #. only if placed in front
      #. only if placed behind
      #. it depends on the structure

   #. At the Brewster angle, 
      #. TE-polarised light is fully reflected 
      #. TM-polarised is fully transmitted
      #. the transmitted wave is evanescent
   
   #. A light ray propagating between points A and B in a medium with inhomogeneous but isotropic refractive index
      #. finds the shortest distance between A and B
      #. finds the extremum travel time between A and B
      #. has a different trajectory depending on the light polarisation [8]{.rmark}

1. Solving the Laplace equation.
    #. Describe the key steps involved in the method of separation of variables for solving the Laplace equation in 3 dimensions.
    #. How does the choice of a coordinate system affect the derivation? [5]{.rmark}

1. Derive the following expressions in spherical coordinates.
   $$\begin{aligned}
\Grad f={}& \frac{\partial f }{\partial r} \vecrh + 
             \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \vecth +
              \frac{1}{r\sin \theta} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \varphi} \vecfh\\[1pt]
\Div\vecA ={}&\frac {1}{r^{2}}  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^{2}A_{r}\right)+ \frac {1}{r\sin \theta }\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta }\left(\sin \theta A_{\theta }\right)+ \frac {1}{r\sin \theta } \frac{\partial A_{\varphi }}{\partial \varphi }\\[1pt]
\Curl \vecA ={}& \frac {1}{r\sin \theta } \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta }\left(A_{\varphi }\sin \theta \right)-\frac{\partial A_{\theta }}{\partial \varphi }\right)\vecrh\\[1pt]
&{}+\frac {1}{r} \left(\frac {1}{\sin \theta } \frac{\partial A_{r}}{\partial \varphi }-\frac{\partial }{\partial r }\left(r A_{\varphi}\right)\right)\vecth\\[1pt] 
&{}+\frac {1}{r} \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial r }\left(r A_{\theta}\right) - \frac{\partial A_{r}}{\partial \theta }\right)\vecfh\\[1pt]
\Lapl f={}& \frac {1}{r^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial r} \left(r^{2}\frac{\partial f }{\partial r} \right) + \frac {1}{r^2\sin \theta } \frac{\partial }{\partial\theta } \left(\sin \theta \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta }\right) + \frac {1}{r^2\sin^2 \theta }\frac{\partial^2 f }{\partial\varphi ^2}
\end{aligned}$$ [1]{.rmark}
